- Ask question, Tell a story to grab attention, Eye contact
## Good Lab presentation
- Broad intro, state the problem statement
- Main slide -> topics to discuss (keep coming back)
- Summary slide
- Display results in clear manner
- Explain mistakes, challenges and failures

- speak naturally
- clear and to the point
- HW Create short video 2-3 minutes on the presentation
## CVIT DD Orientation
- CVPR - computer vision and pattern recognition
- explored ideas is not bad, personal validation
- Analyse results >> Performing experiments
- Learn from failures, know when to stop, don't fall into a rabbit hole
- **NEED TO VALIDATE CLAIMS EXPERIMENTALLY**
- don't look at test set until final model is chosen
- describe your process and methodology process
- send frequent **concise** updates
- provide context to advisors in meetings (they have a lot of them)
- *set your own timeline* -> they wont't give you deadlines
- effective regular meets
- treat meetings like presentations
- *propose next steps* *(!Tell me what to do?*)
- update deviations
- dont't present but analyse results/tables
- present a good visualization (*huge dataset not good*)
- be brave to share failed results
- take notes in meetings
- **maintain ONE single slide deck** -> to keep track
- don't avoid meetings regardless of if you've done the work or not
- **ASK FOR HELP**

## Vladlen Koltun - *Doing (Good) Research* at CVPR 2018
  - research is collective adventure
  - Propose a new problem
  - service & infrastructure
  - Build something inspiring
  - contributing back (opecv, pytorch, tensorflow)
  - **pick an area -> not too late not too early**
  - adopt new tools *(with caution!)*
  - **read papers**
    - look for assumptions
    - find limitations
    - look for surprises and cracks
    - **bombard** with controlled experiments
  - **aware of what's happening around you, lookout for interesting contributions**
  - quality over quantity
  - be willing to restart
  - keep high standards -> no sloppy boring resilts. MOVE ON
  - *READ A LOT* -> THEN WRITE - more clarity

## Writing tips (Research Paper Writing Nuances)
- avoid negatives and passive voice
- avoid 'respectively' (be clear don't leave much to interpretation)
- don't overpopulate with fancy words
- remove needless words(don't write in circles)
- be specific with quantities (**no FEW**)
- Visually engaging (figures, tables, diagrams are a must)
- A good papers figures and tables is a good enough presentation :)
- Have informative section headers
